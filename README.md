## Web App Demo

## Overview
Created a web-app which shows the weather of any location when the user gives the name of the city as input. This app shows the user temperature, humidity and wind speed of that particular city. This weather app fetches the latitude and longitude of the city given as input along with the relevant weather information from OpenWeather API.
## Motivation
It helps you to check the weather regularly and helps you to carry necessary resources before stepping out of your house such as umbrella or wintercoat depending upon the temperature outside.
